Feature: Ariba Source - Run time scenarios

  @BATCH-TS-ARIBA-DSGN-RNTM-01 @BQ_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: Verify user should be able to preview the pipeline when plugin is configured for System Type prod
    When Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    And Select data pipeline type as: "Batch"
    And Select plugin: "Ariba" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "Ariba"
    And Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "Referencename"
