  Scenario Outline: Verify user should be able to validate output schema for the plugin when System Type is prod
    When Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    And Select data pipeline type as: "Batch"
    And Select plugin: "Ariba" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "Ariba"
    And Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "Referencename"
    And Enter input plugin property: "baseURL" with value: "admin.apiendpoint" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    And Enter input plugin property: "realm" with value: "admin.realm" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
