Feature: Ariba Source - Design time scenarios

  @BATCH-TS-ARIBA-DSGN-01 @Required
  Scenario Outline: Verify user should be able to validate output schema for the plugin when System Type is prod
    When Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    And Select plugin: "SAP Ariba" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "SAP Ariba"
    And Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "Referencename"
    And Enter input plugin property: "baseURL" with value: "admin.apiendpoint" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    And Enter input plugin property: "realm" with value: "admin.realm" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    And Select radio button plugin property: "systemType" with value: "prod"
    And Enter input plugin property: "viewTemplateName" with value: "<ViewTemplateName>"

    And Enter input plugin property: "apiKey" with value: "admin.apiKey" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    And Validate "SAP Ariba" plugin properties
    # 1 minute wait - To stop rate limit per minute from exceeding.
    And Wait with a timeout of 60 seconds
    Then Verify the Output Schema matches the Expected Schema: "<ExpectedSchema>"
    Examples:
      | ViewTemplateName                  | ExpectedSchema                                      |
      | SourcingProjectFactSystemView     | aribasourceschema.SourcingProjectFactSystemView     |
      | ProjectFactSystemView             | aribasourceschema.ProjectFactSystemView             |
